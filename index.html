      Hi! Im Ryan Adams. I'm from Malad Idaho, just two hours south of Rexburg.
      I'm studying business managment, but I've got a big varriety of classes
      for my first semester so I can see what I'd like to learn more about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my favorite hobbies are hunting and fishing, snowboarding, and
      pretty much anything else in the outdoors. Some things I like to do when
      I'm indoors include board and card games, cooking, drawing, and now just
      tons of study and homework.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something I'm hoping to gain from this web class is the skills to build a
      website for a future online business. I am excited to figure out how to do
      some simple coding and debugging so that I dont run into any problems with
      my business sites that I can't solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served a mission in Newport Beach California and developed a love of the
      scriptures and personal revelation. One of my favorite scriptures is
      Romans 5: 3-6
